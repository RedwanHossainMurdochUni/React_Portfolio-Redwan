export const HERO_CONTENT = `Computer Science and AI student with a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, and large 
language models (LLMs). Passionate about building AI-driven solutions for real-world applications, with 
hands-on experience in object detection, natural language processing, and data visualisation. Beyond academics, 
I have seized every opportunity to develop my communication and collaboration skills. I have served as an 
elected Murdoch Student Guild council member, won a student partnership program and led a year-long project 
from idea generation to implementation and handover. Furthermore, I have worked as a Peer Academic Coach 
and senior PASS leader at Murdoch University, mentoring fellow students and peers. I firmly believe in a can
do mindset and am eager to learn more and leverage my skills, experience, and determination to tackle 
challenges.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I have a decent foundation in AI & ML, full-stack development, Atlassian, Microsoft Azure, and Power Apps. I also had the opportunity to experience working with people through my roles as a PASS Leader, Peer Academic Coach, and Student as Change Agent at Murdoch University. These roles have helped me build the essential soft skills needed for a client-facing consulting environment.
As a Computer Science and AI graduate, I’m eager to grow by working on real-world IT projects like those at your company. Studying at Murdoch has given me a strong technical foundation, while my on-campus jobs have taught me how to collaborate and connect with others. Through various workshops and initiatives, I’ve developed key professional skills that I believe are valuable in IT consulting. In my role as a Peer Academic Coach, I conducted one-on-one sessions to help students navigate university systems and challenges. As a Senior PASS Leader, I facilitated sessions for over 50 students, guided them through difficult concepts, created presentations and helpful resources. My work with the Student Guild Council and as a Change Agent also taught me how to work in teams to improve campus life. These experiences have prepared me to contribute to complex projects with professionalism and Quality.
